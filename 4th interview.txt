Interviewee: Lio Scarboro Age:20

What are your thoughts on the allotted time for lunch breaks, is it enough?

-It is not enough if you consider the time it takes for students to line up and order food in the cafeteria. If one brings packed lunch, then, this is a non-issue and the time would be enough for one to finish lunch.


How do you spend your breaks?

-I spend my breaks eating, reviewing, and playing games.


Are the food choices on the cafeteria enough?
-The food choices in the cafeteria are enough for the average consumer. Rice meals, Filipino Meals, and Pasta with bread and milktea. However, for those who are looking for burgers and other such things, perhaps select and Jollibee might be a better place and that resides outside the school at the Gas Station that is Shell. If these still do not suit the palate of the student, it would be a far longer walk to the nearest food place away from the school itself.

How about the food line queuing?
-I feel like the lines are indeed too long and this attributed to the lunch hours being too short or at the same time as other classes. Either increase the time allotted to lunch hours or schedule the lunch hours for each set of classes better.

Do you eat your lunch in caf? If not, where?
-No, I eat my lunch in the Library because it's a lot more quiet and calm than the cafeteria.
