What are your thoughts on the allotted time for lunch breaks, is it enough?
My thoughts on the time given for lunch doesn't help considering that the cafeteria becomes full and hard to find tables to eat at and really long lines as well as it doesn't give enough time to eat outside. If you are able to wait till the crowd in the cafeteria decreases it doesn't give enough time to sit down and eat because you only have a few minutes.

How do you spend your breaks?
Getting a few minutes of rest in the library then going to get lunch in the cafeteria.

Are the food choices on the cafeteria enough?
The food choices are plenty.

How about the food line queuing?
The line queues are very long and you're lucky to be able to reach the counter and find a table

Do you eat your lunch in caf? If not, where?
Yes i eat lunch at the cafeteria but when it is too crowded I just eat at the convenient store outside
