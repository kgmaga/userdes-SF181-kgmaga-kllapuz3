What are your thoughts on the allotted time for lunch breaks, is it enough?

-More than enough than you can imagine.  Although college's lunch time is always clashing with the Senior High's.

How do you spend your breaks?

-Eating lunch, freshening up myself to the Comfort room and rest.

Are the food choices on the cafeteria enough?

-Not much vareity, it's weekly menu change which is kind of boring and not good.

How about the food line queuing?

-Line it's not too long since most of the students tend to eat outside rather inside the campus.
