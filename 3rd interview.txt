Interviewee: Neil Ochotorena

What are your thoughts on the allotted time for lunch breaks, is it enough?
1. The allotted time for our lunch break is more than enough, however the amount of student should also be taken into account. Seeing that our cafeteria is small in comparison to the volume of student in APC, maybe implementing different time for breaks would be better.

How do you spend your breaks?
2. After eating lunch, I usually go to the library to kill time.

Are the food choices on the cafeteria enough?
3. They're enough, but having more variety wouldn't hurt.

How about the food line queuing?
4. The line queues used to be better, but this term, it seems like there's a huge influx of students during the lunch time.
